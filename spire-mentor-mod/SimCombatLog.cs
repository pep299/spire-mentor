// SimCombatLog.cs -- the running game's own combat log, on the wire.
//
// The game records every hit, block, power, move and card movement in
// `CombatManager.Instance.History` (MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Combat.History), which
// is exactly what the workbench's combat-log panel shows for a SIMULATED run.
// This maps the real game's entries into the SAME row shape the Rust engine
// emits (`sts2_core::event_log` -> `RunManager.combat_log()`), so a live game
// followed in the workbench renders through the identical Python/React path
// with no second renderer to keep in sync.
//
// Polled, not subscribed: `SimAdvisor` already reads `History.Entries` for its
// settle heuristic, the list only grows within a fight, and a poll cannot leak
// a handler when a combat ends mid-teardown. `Drain()` returns everything
// recorded since the previous call and resets itself when the entry count
// SHRINKS -- the only way that happens is a new combat's fresh History.
//
// Every mapper is defensive: this is display data and a null-ref here would
// take the advice request down with it, so anything unexpected degrades to the
// entry's own `Description` string.
