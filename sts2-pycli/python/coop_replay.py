"""Replay recorded co-op fights in the engine, decision by decision, and diff.

Step 6 of ``docs/plans/2026-10-26-coop-multiseat-engine.md``. The advisor's
workbench run log (``realgame_workbench_log``) stores, per decision, the board
the mod sent (headless ``combat_play`` shape, every teammate's whole seat
included) and the game's own combat-log rows since the previous decision
(``combat_log_raw``). Those rows say who played which card at what, in the
order the game resolved them (``card_play_started`` rows carry ``owner``,
``target_index`` and ``play_index``).

For each pair of consecutive combat boards ``(a, b)`` this builds a whole co-op
fight from ``a`` (``$.coop_full``), plays every seat's recorded cards in the
logged order -- ours through ``apply``, a teammate's through
``apply_as_ally`` -- ends the turn when the log shows the enemies acting, and
diffs the result against ``b``. Each pair starts from the recorded board, so a
divergence does not carry into the next one.

Every pick a player made mid-combat is logged too (``player_choice`` rows,
newer mods): each seat's choices -- in a play, at a turn start -- are answered
from them in order, ours from the open choice, a teammate's through the
engine's ``teammate_chooser``. A teammate's pick with no row is left to the
engine (counted as ``unanswered``).

The game sends us our board when OUR turn starts, which can be before a
teammate has made their turn-start pick (Toasty Mittens). That board shows
their hand from before the pick, and the pick is logged with a later board.
So a pair whose turn-start pick is missing replays on to the board the pick
comes with (``span``). A pair that starts from such a board, and a fight won
while the teammate was still choosing, are skipped (GH #989).

Potions are drunk from the logged seat's belt (a teammate's comes with newer
mods; for older boards the potions the log shows them drinking are put on it).
A potion whose choice screen was still open when the game sent board ``a`` is
already off the belt there; it goes back into the slot it was last seen in.

Usage::

    python -m coop_replay <workbench-run-log.jsonl> [...]

Prints one JSON line per replayed pair and a summary. Pairs the replay cannot
drive yet (our choice screen with no logged pick, a potion not on the drinker's
belt, an unknown owner)
are counted as skipped with the reason, never guessed at.
